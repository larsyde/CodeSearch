# Project Name

CodeSearch

## Purpose
CodeSearch will connect to the TFS server that you point it at, and will get all files that match a predefined set of extensions from all team project collections in that repo. It will then build queryable indices over the whole fileset to enable cross-repo searches using Lucene syntax.

## Installation

Build the solution. The installer project will generate "codesearch.exe" under the Installer subfolder, and you can run it from there.
The installer will add two Windows services to your host computer: Codesearch Indexer Service and Codesearch Webhost Service. These can be run and 
restarted individually, and will update indices and serve query results, respectively.

The main search form can be accessed at http://servername:8102/ after successful installation and when the search index is built.
Logs are in the Logs subfolder under the installation directory.

## Usage

Access search form at http://servername:8102/ after code indexing is complete, and submit your query
